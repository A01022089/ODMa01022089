Ranges
======

A range specification is a dimension name, followed by an optional negation
character ('!'), and a starting and ending value separated by a colon, 
surrounded by parentheses or square brackets.  Either the starting or ending
values can be omitted.  Parentheses indicate an open endpoint that doesn't
include the adjacent value.  Square brackets indicate a closed endpoint
that includes the adjacent value.
