0.6.11 (2015-09-21)
-------------------
* minor doc syntax fixes
* saner installation instructions from source.
* add missing includes to make headers compile standalone
  - add cstddef to introduce std::size_t
  - add parameters.hpp to its implementation (works because of #pragma once)
* fix bsd-license check script
  Not all Copyright is (1.) from 2011 and (2.) by Willow Garage
  autofix is undefined if ECTO_LICENSE_AUTOFIX is not exported.
* Re-add thread library to linker list
  Regression caused by 8e354b5aa8281ea8117fc93adb290998b7810be7
* docs about various entities that affect graph execution, also other minor cleanups.
  Removed the redundancies in the install docs (2x install instructions and 2x dependencies)
  and cleaned the place up a bit.
* Provide test for ecto::BREAK return value.
* implement ecto::BREAK behavior
  This patch makes ecto schedule the next iteration
  through the plasm with ecto::BREAK as discussed in
  https://github.com/plasmodic/ecto/issues/251
* remove some old Willow Garage URLs
* update doc's url

0.6.10 (2015-07-22)
-------------------
* update test for future fix
* potentially fix compilation with Boost 1.58
  could be a fix for `#275 <https://github.com/plasmodic/ecto/issues/275>`_
* Contributors: Vincent Rabaud

0.6.9 (2015-05-08)
------------------
* re-add some Python tests
* add missing PySide dependency
* Contributors: Vincent Rabaud

0.6.8 (2015-03-13)
------------------
* threadable plasms update.
  This reintroduces some level of threading into ecto. It was initially
  removed in c2a24a51, but this left some legacy code
  wasn't working as expressed in the documentation. These updates
  allow parallel execution of plasms in separate threads. It doesn't
  quite reach the scope of the original plan for ecto (threading for
  free *inside* a plasms computation), but it does cover several useful
  scenarios.
* convenience class for scheduling plasms across threads.
* Reformatted cell processing result handler (trivial).
  For clarity, and points back to an issue created which discusses
  the BREAK/CONTINUE options.
* Don't clobber the underlying c++ executions when aborting, be graceful.
  Previously used PyErr_SetInterrupt which would send a keyboard interrupt
  back to the controlling python script. However we don't want to abort
  in this way - it is preferable to let the execution gracefully bow out.
  More information and the actual code that does the bowing out is in
  pull request `#250 <https://github.com/plasmodic/ecto/issues/250>`_.
* activate gil release/call macros
* Be free of the GIL!
  This lets ecto pipeline processing be free of its evil overlord, the [GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock). That is, you can now schedule different plasms in different threads...e.g. some pseudocode:
  # ...construct some plasms
  image_scheduler = ecto.Scheduler(image_plasm)
  odometry_scheduler = ecto.Scheduler(odometry_plasm)
  image_thread = threading.Thread(name="image_thread", target=image_scheduler.execute)
  odometry_thread = threading.Thread(name="odometry_thread", target=odometry_scheduler.execute)
  image_thread.start()
  odometry_thread.start()
  image_thread.join()
  odometry_thread.join()
  ```
  Of course, inside a cell's `process()` call, you can always grab the GIL momentarily if you need to using the opposite macro...`ECTO_SCOPED_CALLPYTHON`.
* Bugfix python lookup for internal class variables
  Probably went unnoticed for a long time since it wasn't used. Came across this (I think - was quite a while ago) while fleshing out pythonic cell construction with names and parameter args. Should have gone in at the same time as 39b9cad9.
* fix doc
  fixes `#239 <https://github.com/plasmodic/ecto/issues/239>`_
